# Lab-Assignment-4-OOP

Create two user-defined exceptions (name your own exceptions)  that validate number of login tries of a user with a password.  User is only allowed up to maximum of 3 tries.  If user already exceeds the third try, a user-defined exception will handle it.  If user has entered an invalid password, another user-defined exception will handle it.  Make "password" as the valid password.
